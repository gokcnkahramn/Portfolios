In this project, I tried to learn the basics of Django.
In our project, we can record the products we shop with and the amount of products we purchase with a simple API.
After registering the products, we can view our products in JSON format on the site.

To write our own admin information: py manage.py createsuperuser

Admin page: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

JSON format of the product list: http://127.0.0.1:8000/myapp/api/user-table/
